                    The Wrapper includes a lightweight native library 
                    which is used to handle system events. 
                    The library also contains a native method,
                    which is used for testing, to cause an access violation in native code due to a NULL reference.
                </p>

                    Depending on the JVM, this will give different output. 
                    In the example below, the JVM created a core dump which takes about a minute to save.
                    During this time, the JVM appears to be hung so the Wrapper kills and restarts it.
                </p>
